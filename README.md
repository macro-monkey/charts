# charts

My charts repository is a place where I make my python charting code freely available for download and use. 
As much as possible, the code includes an API feed and avoids csv or other data source files.

Current files:

tsa_passenger_data - source: web scrape - creates a chart showing YoY TSA checkpoint data to illustrate the impact of COVID-19 on travel passenger volume 
employment_charts - source: FRED - creates stacked charts showing employment data (unemployment rate, labor force participation and population employment ratio
